# Sup, Iâ€™m 0x90

---


Iâ€™m a student passionate about embedded systems and modern software development. My primary focus is building reliable and efficient applications using Rust, especially for embedded devices and Android. I'm also exploring the Android ecosystem through Kotlin, combining native performance with mobile development.

I'm a fast learner and enjoy understanding how things work at a low level. From microcontrollers to mobile apps, I aim to write clean, safe, and performant code.

Tech Stack & Core Skills

Rust â€“ Main language: safe, fast, ideal for embedded, mobile, and UI (via Slint)

Kotlin â€“ Currently learning, focused on Android UI and integration with native Rust libraries

C++ â€“ Background in system-level programming and Windows internals

Python / Go â€“ Used for scripting, automation, networking tools

Assembly â€“ Useful for understanding low-level mechanisms and debugging

Arduino â€“ Used in support of embedded concepts and hardware experiments



---

Interests

Native Android development powered by Rust

Cross-compiling .so libraries in Rust for mobile platforms

Performance tuning and profiling (VTune, perf, cargo instruments)

Safe memory management, FFI, and low-level optimization

UI development for embedded/mobile using Rust (Slint) and Kotlin

Systems programming and portability across Linux, Android, and microcontrollers



---

Currently Learning

Android architecture with Kotlin (Jetpack, Compose, JNI)

Building and linking native Rust libraries for use in Android

Advanced performance profiling and debugging

Designing cross-platform, efficient Rust crates

Patterns for clean Kotlin â†” Rust integration



---

Projects

Rust

CLI tools, embedded utilities, system software, UI apps with Slint

.so libraries targeting Android logic modules


Kotlin + Rust

Prototypes where Android UI (Kotlin) connects to performant Rust backends


C++

Tools for binary analysis and PE introspection


Python / Go

Network analyzers, process tools, automation utilities


Assembly 

Low level architecture 



---

Goal

To build modern Android applications where:

Rust handles the core logic, ensuring safety and performance

Kotlin powers the UI and interacts with Rust via JNI

All parts of the system are well-structured, portable, and profiled

The final result combines native speed with modern UX



---

Looking to Collaborate

I'm open to everything, especially:

Rust-based Android or embedded projects

High-performance tools with low memory/CPU overhead

Systems where profiling, safety, and portability matter

Rust/Kotlin hybrid applications or libraries
