# 👋 Hi, I’m @riccio8

I'm a student with a passion for hacking, particularly in reverse engineering. I learn quickly and am currently mastering Assembly language. C++, Python, and Go (Golang) are my main programming languages. I'm also improving my basic **Arduino** skills. While I have some experience with **Unity**, I’m not particularly passionate about game development but have a solid understanding of the basics.

## 👀 Interests
I’m interested in everything related to computers and technology, especially low-level programming, cybersecurity, and Windows API development.

## 🌱 Currently Learning
I’m currently focused on mastering Assembly and enhancing my skills in C++, specifically building tools using **Windows APIs** and working hard on programs for **PE file analysis**.

## 💼 Projects
- **C++**: Developed various tools for **PE file analysis**, continuously improving and adding new features.
- **Golang**: Built a **CLI tool** for managing processes on Windows.
- **Python**: Created tools for **network analysis** across different protocols.
- **Assembly**: Developed a **DLL breakpoint detector** as part of my reverse engineering studies.
- AND SOME OTHER STUFF...

## 💞️ Looking to Collaborate
I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to **hacking**, **reverse engineering**, **malware analysis**, or other low-level programming and cybersecurity endeavors.
