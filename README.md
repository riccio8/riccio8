# Sup, I‚Äôm 0x90

I'm a student passionate about hacking, especially reverse engineering. I‚Äôm a quick learner currently focused on mastering Assembly language. My main programming languages are C++, Python, and Go (Golang). Improving a lot my assembly skills. I‚Äôm also improving my basic **Arduino** skills and have experience with **Unity**‚Äîthough I'm not particularly passionate about game development- I understand all fast and well.

## üëÄ Interests
I‚Äôm interested in computers and technology, especially low-level programming, cybersecurity, Windows API development, and network analysis.

## üå± Currently Learning
I‚Äôm diving into Assembly and C++, specifically building tools using **Windows APIs** and developing programs for **PE file analysis**.

## üíº Projects
- **C++**: Developed various tools for **PE file analysis**, continuously enhancing and adding features.
- **Golang**: Built a **CLI tool** for managing processes on Windows.
- **Python**: Created tools for **network analysis** across different protocols.
- **Assembly**: Developed a **DLL breakpoint detector** as part of my reverse engineering studies, and for a lot of other Security related stuff.
