# Sup, I‚Äôm 0x90

I'm a student passionate about hacking, especially reverse engineering. I‚Äôm a quick learner currently focused on mastering Assembly language. My main programming languages are C++, Python, and Go (Golang). Improving a lot my assembly skills. I‚Äôm also improving my basic **Arduino** skills and have experience with **Unity**‚Äîthough I'm not particularly passionate about game development- I understand all fast and well.
